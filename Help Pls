Hello, I am Brazilian and a beginner in game translation to my language. 
I’ve been having some issues with mods created by others, so I decided to get into this field of game modification and translation. 
However, I’m not an expert; I’m quite new to this. I didn’t understand how to use your program. Could you help me? I know I’ll probably need to use Python.
I would appreciate it if you could provide more clarification.
